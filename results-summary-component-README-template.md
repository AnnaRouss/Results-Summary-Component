### What I learned

This was much much harder then it looked took me almost two weeks to make it and I still feel like it could have used more tweaking as its much bigger then I meant it to be but I do like that it looks okay.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<button class="custom-button">Continue</button>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: linear-gradient(to top,hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0), hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1));
  .custom-button:hover {
    background: linear-gradient(to top,hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0), hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1));
    color: hsl(224, 30%, 27%);
    font-family: Hanken Grotesk;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 12px;
}
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
 [
  {
    "category": "Reaction",
    "score": 80,
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon-reaction.svg"
  },
  {
    "category": "Memory",
    "score": 92,
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon-memory.svg"
  },
  {
    "category": "Verbal",
    "score": 61,
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon-verbal.svg"
  },
  {
    "category": "Visual",
    "score": 72,
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon-visual.svg"
